	<h3>Getting Started Guide</h3>
	<div id="getting-started" >
        <h4>Introduction</h4>
            <p>It can be difficult learning a new skill, particularly something considered as 
            different as programming. This is not helped if you have issues getting set up.
            <br>
            The goal of this guide is to provide a nice walkthrough, guiding you through installing
            everything you need for participation in BioPUG sessions, or programming in Python in
            general. If you have any issues, please feel free to contact 
            <a href="mailto:s.belluzzo+biopug@student.unimelb.edu.au">me</a> for help.</p>
        <h4>Installing Python</h4>
            <p>There are many ways to install Python, most of which are very easy. We are focussing 
            on scientific programming, and unfortunately many of the packages involved can be 
            complicated to install yourself. To avoid issues and confusion, we are currently recommending
            using the <a href="https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda">Anaconda Python Distribution</a>,
            from Continuum Analytics, specifically designed for working with data and scientific computing.
            While a large download, it contains many useful packages we will be using, and allows easy 
            installation of extra Python packages and modules.</p>
            
            <h5>Downloading the Anaconda Python Distribution</h5>
                <p>Continuum Analytics has installers available for Windows, Mac OS X and Linux on their 
                <a href="http://continuum.io/downloads.html">website</a>. Pick the appropriate installer
                for your operating system. In most cases, you'll want the 64-bit version. You won't need any of
                the other packages or add-ons for our sessions, or most programming you are likely to do.</p>
            <h5>Installing the Anaconda Python Distribution</h5>
                <p>Installation differs depending on the operating system you are on. Instructions for installation 
                on Windows, Mac OS X and Linux can all be found on the 
                <a href="http://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/install.html">Continuum Analytics website</a>. If asked 
                whether you want Anaconda added to the system path, say yes. This allows you to run it from the
                command line.</p>
                <p>I've included extra notes below to aid in the install on Mac OS X and Linux.</p>
                <h6>Mac OS X</h6>
                <p>The Terminal application can be found in the Utilities directory in your Applications
                directory.</p>
                <h6>Linux</h6>
                <p>The particular application you need to run can vary, depending on your environment.
                However, look for menu items called "Terminal" or "Console", or various spellings of such,
                as these are likely to be terminal programs.</p>
            <h5>Checking the installation worked</h5>
                <p>To confirm that we've installed Python correctly, open a terminal, either following the above
                directions, or if on Windows, by opening the Command Prompt, in the Accessories directory in
                the Start menu.</p>
                <p>Once your terminal is opened, type "python" into it and press Enter. You should then see 
                something like the prompt below.</p>
                <!-- Code Python -->
                <pre>
                Python 2.7.4 |Anaconda 1.5.1 (x86_64)| (default, May  9 2013, 12:12:00)
                [GCC 4.0.1 (Apple Inc. build 5493)] on darwin
                Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
                >>>
                </pre>
                <p>If you see a Python prompt similar to the one shown above, congratulations, you're ready to go. 
                If not, contact me to help you.</p>

        <h4>Installing a text editor</h4>
            <p>A text editor is an important component of a programmer's toolkit. Why do you need a text editor? 
            Well, Microsoft Word can't do everything, and in programming, it's not very helpful at all. A good 
            text editor will highlight your syntax as you write, helping draw your eye to important parts. It
            can also help autocomplete, based on things you've already typed in your program, helping to avoid
            spelling mistakes that can make programs misbehave.</p>
            <p>For beginners, we are recommending <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text</a>.
            Download and install it in the usual way for your operating system.</p>
