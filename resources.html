	<h4>Python Resources</h4>
	<h5>General Reference</h5>
	<ul>
		<li><a href="http://docs.python.org/2/">Python 2 Documentation</a>. Of particular interest, the tutorial and library reference, describing code included with a normal install of Python 2.7.</li>
		<li><a href="http://docs.python.org/3/">Python 3 Documentation</a>. As above, but for Python 3. Of particular interest, the tutorial and library reference, describing code included with a normal install of Python 3, and differences to Python 2.</li>
