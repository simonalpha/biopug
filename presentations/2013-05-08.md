##Today
We're trying something a little different.

Looking at program design, and we're going to collaboratively write a program.



##Introduce yourself
Let's get to know each other a little...

- Your name?
- Which lab/department/institute?
- What uses for programming you have?
- A simple task you do often (making a sandwich, a PCR, driving a car)



Remember that simple task?

Write it out in a way a toddler, an undergrad, someone who's never done it before can understand and do it.



You've written a program! SOPs are programs, protocols are programs, recipes are programs.



##The Plan
We're going to use a modified version of the "Coding Dojo", where you will all work together to build a program.


The original method of Coding Dojos revolves around Test-Driven Development (TDD). While testing is important, I don't think the TDD methodology unmodified is the best fit for scientific computing.

That, and we haven't learnt about testing yet!


However, we will cover these methodologies, so you can apply or modify them as you see fit (or take the best bits from each)



##Coding Dojo Principles
- This is a **safe environment**, collaborative, inclusive and non-competitive.
- We aim to **continuously learn**, regardless of your level. It is **OK to fail**, especially when learning (this is how we learn!), and using **different approaches** will help you get new insights.
- Most importantly, we progress in **baby steps**, each step towards the solution should be small and understandible - everyone should be able to comprehend, and feel capable of implementing it later.
- This is not an exam, looking things up is allowed, indeed encouraged!



##How Coding Dojos run
- **Problem choosing:** We choose what to do (vote)
- **Problem discussion:** We discuss how we could solve it, agree on an approach and list of todos.
- **Coding session:** We rotate through pairs, in short cycles, coding to solve the problem.
- **Retrospective:** We leave enough time to reflect and discuss what we've learnt.

Also the sensei/organiser, who moderates and aids where needed.



So, two volunteers?
